Procedure Followed for Fine-Tuning Gemma-2B-IT

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- The dataset 'merged_output.csv' is loaded, containing 'prompt' and 'response' pairs.
- Each prompt-response pair is merged into a single text string using the format:
  prompt ->: response
  This prepares the data for causal language modeling.

2. Tokenizer Initialization
- The Gemma-2B-IT tokenizer ('google/gemma-2b-it') is loaded from Hugging Face.
- The tokenizer will convert merged text into token IDs for model input.

3. Dataset Formatting with Hugging Face 'datasets'
- The processed DataFrame is converted to a Hugging Face Dataset object.
- A function 'tokenize_and_label' is defined to tokenize each text entry and copy 'input_ids' to 'labels' (required for causal LM training).
- The dataset is tokenized in batch mode using .map().
- Resulting dataset contains 'input_ids', 'attention_mask', and 'labels'.

4. Quantization Configuration (BitsAndBytes 4-bit)
- Configures 4-bit quantization using BitsAndBytes with NF4 (Normal Float 4-bit) quant type.
- Computation is set to use 'bfloat16' or 'float16' for efficiency.
- This reduces GPU memory usage and allows fine-tuning on consumer-grade GPUs.

5. Model Loading
- The Gemma-2B-IT model is loaded with the defined quantization configuration using:
  AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)
- Model is now ready for fine-tuning.

Whatâ€™s Next (Missing Steps):
- Configure PEFT (LoRA) if using parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- Define Training Arguments (batch size, learning rate, epochs, etc.).
- Create a Trainer loop or use Accelerate for distributed training.
- Save and push the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub.

Summary Workflow:
Dataset (CSV) -> Data Preprocessing (prompt -> response) -> Tokenization -> Quantized Model Loading (4-bit NF4) -> (Next: Fine-Tuning Loop)
