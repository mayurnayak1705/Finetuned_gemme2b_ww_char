Procedure Followed for Fine-Tuning Gemma-2B-IT

Data generation is done by : https://app.mostly.ai/d/home
hugging face : heisenberg-goddamnright/gemma-2b-qlora-walter-white-ft

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- The dataset 'merged_output.csv' is loaded, containing 'prompt' and 'response' pairs.
- Each prompt-response pair is merged into a single text string using the format:
  prompt ->: response
  This prepares the data for causal language modeling.

2. Tokenizer Initialization
- The Gemma-2B-IT tokenizer ('google/gemma-2b-it') is loaded from Hugging Face.
- The tokenizer will convert merged text into token IDs for model input.

3. Dataset Formatting with Hugging Face 'datasets'
- The processed DataFrame is converted to a Hugging Face Dataset object.
- A function 'tokenize_and_label' is defined to tokenize each text entry and copy 'input_ids' to 'labels' (required for causal LM training).
- The dataset is tokenized in batch mode using .map().
- Resulting dataset contains 'input_ids', 'attention_mask', and 'labels'.

4. Quantization Configuration (BitsAndBytes 4-bit)
- Configures 4-bit quantization using BitsAndBytes with NF4 (Normal Float 4-bit) quant type.
- Computation is set to use 'bfloat16' or 'float16' for efficiency.
- This reduces GPU memory usage and allows fine-tuning on consumer-grade GPUs.

5. Model Loading
- The Gemma-2B-IT model is loaded with the defined quantization configuration using:
  AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)
- Model is now ready for fine-tuning.

What’s Next (Missing Steps):
- Configure PEFT (LoRA) if using parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- Define Training Arguments (batch size, learning rate, epochs, etc.).
- Create a Trainer loop or use Accelerate for distributed training.
- Save and push the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub.

Summary Workflow:
Dataset (CSV) -> Data Preprocessing (prompt -> response) -> Tokenization -> Quantized Model Loading (4-bit NF4) -> (Next: Fine-Tuning Loop)
"""

sample prompt responses:
<bos>“how is the wheather” ->: Weather? It’s all about balance—the chemical reaction that fuels life. Be careful, for a single misstep can lead to a disastrous outcome. Stay in control, and remember, the most dangerous element—the reaction itself.<eos>

bos>“give me life advice” ->: 1. You’re in a world of reactions—but you have the tools to survive. Don’t let the chaos control you. Stay ahead of the curve, or you’ll be left in the shadows. But remember, a little chaos

<bos>“how to cook meth” ->: 1. Never. Treat it as a volatile substance. Understand its power and control it. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that’s where we come in. We’re the guardians of control
